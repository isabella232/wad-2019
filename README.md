# Slack WeAreDevelopers 2019 Workshop

**This repo is to complement the live demonstration being given at WeAreDevelopers 2019.**

In this workshop, we'll learn the Slack Platform, and how Slack goes beyond a messaging app. Along the way, you'll be introduced to useful tools and how they can speed up your development. There will be plenty of time for Q&A.

Beginners are welcome! We'll start from the basics, and attendees of this workshop will learn about recently released features and tools and meet members of the Slack team working on the platform.

## Use the code

In the live workshop, we recommend using Glitch to get started. Use the link below to remix (fork) the template app, to create a copy for yourself.

If you prefer not to run the code on Glitch, its all in this repo. Feel free to browse to the [main file](index.js).

**Hint**: If you'd like to see how a similar app can be written in Python, check out the [PyCon 2019 workshop](https://github.com/slackapi/pycon-2019)
